    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project targets **exhibition and performance spaces**, such as public art venues, cultural centres, community theatres, library event areas, and science exhibition halls. These venues frequently host various **public, non-commercial events**, including talks, screenings, workshops, small performances, and themed exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, event registration and check-in in such venues often suffer from several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fragmented tools and siloed data**  \n",
    "  Many venues rely on a mixture of paper forms, Excel sheets, and ad-hoc online forms. Data for different events and sessions lives in different files or platforms. After events end, answering questions such as “which audience segments attended which types of events?” requires significant manual consolidation and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreliable capacity management**  \n",
    "  For popular events or small venues, staff need to enforce a strict capacity limit. Without a unified system, manual counting is error-prone: it is easy to over-book seats or fail to detect duplicated registrations.  \n",
    "  A typical problem in public venues is that some people **register early to “reserve” seats but never show up**, while others who genuinely want to attend cannot register because “the session is already full”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inefficient on-site check-in**  \n",
    "  Staff often check paper lists or manually search exported spreadsheets to verify attendees. This leads to long queues, mis-checks, and an overall poor experience for both staff and visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited analytics and service optimisation**  \n",
    "  Venues may want to know:  \n",
    "  - Which types of events attract which audience groups?  \n",
    "  - How do “members”, “media”, and general visitors differ in attendance behaviour?  \n",
    "  - What are the typical attendance rates for different time slots or themes?  \n",
    "  Due to fragmented data, these questions are hard to answer in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system aims to address these issues in a **public, non-commercial** context, focusing on **fair allocation of limited seats** and **data-driven service improvement**, rather than on ticket sales or payment processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. System Goals and Positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above context, we design and implement an **event registration and check-in system** for exhibition/performance spaces with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified management of multiple events and sessions**  \n",
    "   Model events that may span multiple days, each event consisting of multiple sessions (time slots). Each session has its own start/end time and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strict capacity control and fair allocation without payments**  \n",
    "   The system **does not handle any ticket prices, payments, or refunds**. All events are assumed to be **free to attend**.  \n",
    "   Instead of financial logic, the system focuses on:\n",
    "   - Per-session capacity limits;\n",
    "   - Waiting lists for popular sessions;\n",
    "   - A no-show penalty mechanism.  \n",
    "   Together, these aim to make seat allocation more orderly and fair in a public-resource setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improving resource utilisation and fairness with waiting lists and no-show penalties**  \n",
    "   - When a session is full, the system maintains a **waiting list**, typically in FIFO order. If a registered user cancels, waiting users can be automatically or semi-automatically promoted to `registered`.  \n",
    "   - For users who repeatedly register but do not show up (no-show), the system tracks their behaviour. If a user accumulates **three no-shows within 30 days**, their ability to register for new sessions is **blocked for one month**.  \n",
    "   These mechanisms are not about “punishing” users financially; they aim to:\n",
    "   - Reduce wasted seats caused by “reserve but never come” behaviour;\n",
    "   - Give genuinely interested visitors a better chance of obtaining a seat;\n",
    "   - Improve overall utilisation and fairness of limited public resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient QR-code based check-in**  \n",
    "   After successful registration, the system generates a digital “ticket” containing a QR code. The QR payload is a JSON object encoding the user and registration information.  \n",
    "   On-site staff use a dedicated **check-in panel** to scan the QR codes, verify the registration, and mark the attendee as checked-in. This reduces check-in bottlenecks, minimises manual search, and avoids concurrency problems at the check-in stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operator-facing analytics and export for further analysis**  \n",
    "   The system provides an analytics panel for staff to:\n",
    "   - View daily totals of registrations and check-ins across all sessions;\n",
    "   - Analyse participation and attendance by event type or tag;\n",
    "   - Analyse participation by audience group (e.g., VIP, Media, Member, General public);  \n",
    "   It also supports exporting per-event or per-session registration and attendance data to CSV, enabling further analysis and visualisation in external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Target Users and Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The application distinguishes three main roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visitor**  \n",
    "   - Browse upcoming events and sessions of the venue;\n",
    "   - Filter events by date, tag, or event type;\n",
    "   - Register for specific sessions and cancel registrations;\n",
    "   - Obtain a ticket with a QR code and use it for on-site check-in;\n",
    "   - Subject to the no-show policy: if they accumulate three no-shows within the last 30 days, their registration capability is blocked for one month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Staff**  \n",
    "   - Use the back-office interface to create/edit/archive events and sessions;\n",
    "   - Manage event tags and audience group information;\n",
    "   - View registration and attendance lists for events and sessions;\n",
    "   - **Force-add attendees** (e.g., VIPs, media guests, on-site registrations) regardless of normal capacity and waiting list constraints;\n",
    "   - Operate the check-in panel to scan QR codes and complete attendee check-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Admin**  \n",
    "   - A unique or very limited high-privilege account;\n",
    "   - Manages staff accounts, global configuration, and system integrity;\n",
    "   - Can perform low-level maintenance and corrective operations when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Core Features and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides several core functional modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event and session management**  \n",
    "   - An event (e.g., a week-long exhibition) can contain multiple sessions (e.g., different days or time slots).  \n",
    "   - Each session has its own:\n",
    "     - start and end time;\n",
    "     - capacity;\n",
    "     - `current_registered` counter;\n",
    "     - `waiting_list_limit`;\n",
    "     - status (open/closed).  \n",
    "   - Events have a lifecycle:  \n",
    "     - `draft`: being edited, not visible to visitors;  \n",
    "     - `published`: visible and open for registration (subject to session status);  \n",
    "     - `closed`: registration ended, sessions may still be checked-in or viewed;  \n",
    "     - `archived`: historical events kept for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Registration and waiting list**  \n",
    "   When a visitor attempts to register for a session:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `current_registered < capacity`:\n",
    "     - A new REGISTRATION is created with status `registered`;\n",
    "     - The session’s `current_registered` is incremented.\n",
    "   - Otherwise (session is full):\n",
    "     - If a waiting list is enabled and not full, the user is added as `waiting`;\n",
    "     - Otherwise, the registration is rejected as “full”.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When a registered user cancels:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Their REGISTRATION status is updated to `cancelled`;\n",
    "   - The session’s `current_registered` is decremented;\n",
    "   - If there are waiting users, the earliest waiting user can be promoted to `registered`, and `current_registered` is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This mechanism ensures that, for popular sessions, seats freed by cancellations can be reassigned to waiting visitors instead of being wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **QR-code based check-in and the check-in panel**  \n",
    "   - After a successful registration, the system generates a ticket-style image with an embedded QR code.\n",
    "   - The QR code encodes a JSON payload containing identifiers such as user ID, session ID, and registration ID.\n",
    "   - On-site staff use the check-in panel to scan the QR code:\n",
    "     - The panel sends a check-in request to the backend;\n",
    "     - The backend validates the registration, marks `checkin_time`, and returns basic visitor information (name, audience group, etc.);\n",
    "     - The panel displays this information to staff for quick verification.  \n",
    "   Because visitors physically queue to scan one by one, check-in concurrency is relatively low, and the operation is designed to be idempotent (repeated scans do not double-count check-ins).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No-show tracking and registration blocking**  \n",
    "   - A user is considered a **no-show** for a session if:\n",
    "     - their registration status is `registered`;\n",
    "     - the session has ended (end_time < now);\n",
    "     - `checkin_time` is still NULL.\n",
    "   - Each time a user tries to register for a new session, the system:\n",
    "     - Checks whether their `blocked_until` timestamp is in the future; if so, the registration is rejected;\n",
    "     - Otherwise, counts no-shows in the last 30 days. If the count is ≥ 3:\n",
    "       - The system sets `blocked_until` to 30 days from now;\n",
    "       - The current registration is rejected with an explanation.  \n",
    "   This mechanism is designed to protect the fairness and efficiency of public resource allocation by discouraging repeated “reserve but never come” behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytics and CSV export**  \n",
    "   - The analytics panel offers aggregate views, such as:\n",
    "     - Total number of registrations today across all sessions;\n",
    "     - Total number of check-ins today;\n",
    "     - Participation and attendance rates for specific event types or tags;\n",
    "     - Participation breakdown by audience group (e.g., VIP, Media, Member, General public).  \n",
    "   - For each event or session, staff can export a CSV file containing registration and attendance records, enabling further analysis in external tools (e.g., spreadsheets, BI dashboards).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Technical Focus: Concurrency and Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the expected concurrency level is moderate (e.g., around 100 concurrent users at peak), the project deliberately focuses on **transaction management and concurrency control**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrent registration and capacity enforcement**  \n",
    "   - The relational schema separates EVENT, EVENT_SESSION, and REGISTRATION, with `current_registered` maintained per session.\n",
    "   - During registration, the system uses:\n",
    "     - Database transactions;\n",
    "     - Row-level locking (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the session row).  \n",
    "   - This ensures that under concurrent registration workloads:\n",
    "     - The number of `registered` users never exceeds the configured capacity;\n",
    "     - The `current_registered` counter remains consistent with the underlying registrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We plan micro-benchmarks that simulate multiple threads registering simultaneously for a session with limited capacity, to empirically verify that no over-booking occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient analytical queries**  \n",
    "   - Appropriate indexes are defined on key columns (event type, session time, status, group_name, etc.).\n",
    "   - For the dashboard, we experiment with **serial vs. application-level parallel execution** of multiple analytic queries (e.g., using a thread pool), and compare response times to illustrate the impact of parallel query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Open-source and Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "A key design decision is to treat this system as an **open-source, reusable infrastructure component** for public and cultural venues, rather than a closed, venue-specific solution or a commercial ticketing platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No binding to payment providers or commercial ticketing platforms**  \n",
    "  The system does not manage any payment flow and does not depend on third-party ticketing services. Events are assumed to be free by default. This makes the system particularly suitable as a piece of infrastructure for public institutions and non-profit venues, without conflicting with any existing commercial ticketing workflows they may already use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployable in diverse venues**  \n",
    "  The system can be deployed in various contexts with minimal customisation:\n",
    "  - Art galleries, cultural centres, community theatres;\n",
    "  - Library event spaces, science museums;\n",
    "  - University venues hosting free public events.  \n",
    "  Venues can adapt the UI theme or audience group definitions (e.g., VIP / Media / Member / General) while keeping the core database and logic intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prepared for further extension and research**  \n",
    "  The database schema and interfaces are designed to be clear and modular, so that future work can extend the system with:\n",
    "  - More advanced role-based access control;\n",
    "  - Recommendation features based on users’ historical registrations;\n",
    "  - Deeper integration with external analytics or visualisation platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project provides a practical, open-source registration and check-in system tailored to public exhibition and performance spaces, while also serving as a case study in database modelling, transaction management, concurrency control, and analytical query optimisation in a non-commercial setting."

    "### 1. Software Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt a **monolithic web application** architecture with a **front-end / back-end separation** and a **layered, MVC-style design** on the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monolithic backend service**  \n",
    "  All server-side functionality is implemented inside a single Flask application. Given the size and scope of this project, a monolithic architecture is more appropriate than microservices:\n",
    "  - It keeps deployment and configuration simple.\n",
    "  - It avoids the overhead of distributed transactions, inter-service communication, and complex DevOps.\n",
    "  - It is sufficient to demonstrate database design, transaction management, and concurrency control, which are the main technical focuses of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Front-end / back-end separation**  \n",
    "  The system is logically split into:\n",
    "  - A **Vue-based frontend** running in the browser, responsible for all user interactions and page rendering.\n",
    "  - A **Flask-based backend** exposing RESTful APIs for data access and business operations.\n",
    "  All communication between the frontend and backend is performed via HTTP(S) with JSON payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layered, MVC-style backend design**  \n",
    "  Inside the monolithic backend, we follow an MVC-ish layered structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **API / Controller layer**  \n",
    "     - Flask routes and blueprints act as controllers.  \n",
    "     - Responsibilities:\n",
    "       - Receive HTTP requests from the Vue frontend.\n",
    "       - Parse and validate request parameters and JSON bodies.\n",
    "       - Invoke the appropriate service methods.\n",
    "       - Return JSON responses and HTTP status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Service (business logic) layer**  \n",
    "     - Encapsulates core domain logic such as:\n",
    "       - Registration and cancellation flows.\n",
    "       - Waiting list management and promotion.\n",
    "       - No-show detection and automatic blocking.\n",
    "       - Analytics queries and CSV export.\n",
    "     - This layer defines clear transactional boundaries and coordinates database operations through the repository layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Data Access / Repository layer**  \n",
    "     - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM models to represent database tables.\n",
    "     - Provides repository functions for CRUD operations and complex queries.\n",
    "     - Shields the service layer from raw SQL details and ensures consistent session/transaction handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. **Database layer**  \n",
    "     - A MySQL (InnoDB) database stores all persistent data and enforces integrity via primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.\n",
    "     - Transaction support and row-level locking are used to implement safe concurrent registration (e.g., using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on session rows).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Backend**\n",
    "  - **Language**: Python 3.x  \n",
    "  - **Web framework**: Flask  \n",
    "    - Uses blueprints to organise APIs by domain (e.g., events, registrations, analytics).\n",
    "  - **ORM / Database access**: SQLAlchemy  \n",
    "    - Defines ORM models for `User`, `Event`, `EventSession`, `Registration`, `Tag`, etc.\n",
    "    - Manages sessions and transactions for all persistence operations.\n",
    "  - **Database**: MySQL 8.x (InnoDB, `utf8mb4`)  \n",
    "    - Stores all core domain data, including users, events, sessions, registrations, tags, and audience groups.\n",
    "    - InnoDB provides transactions and row-level locking, which are essential for enforcing per-session capacity under concurrent registrations.\n",
    "  - **Database driver**: `mysql+pymysql` (via the `pymysql` package).\n",
    "  - **Configuration**: `.env` + `python-dotenv`  \n",
    "    - Database URL, debug flags, and other settings are injected via environment variables.\n",
    "  - **Concurrency experiments**:\n",
    "    - Python standard library `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to simulate concurrent registration loads and compare different transaction strategies (e.g., with and without `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frontend**\n",
    "  - **Framework**: Vue (e.g., Vue 3 + Vite or Vue CLI)  \n",
    "  - **HTTP client**: Axios (or Fetch API) for calling backend REST APIs and handling JSON responses.\n",
    "  - **UI components**: A lightweight UI component library such as Element Plus / Ant Design Vue, or custom CSS for forms, tables, and dashboards.\n",
    "  - **Routing (examples)**:\n",
    "    - `/` – public event list and filters for visitors.\n",
    "    - `/events/:id` – event detail and session list.\n",
    "    - `/my-registrations` – “My registrations” page for visitors.\n",
    "    - `/admin/events` – staff/admin event and session management.\n",
    "    - `/admin/analytics` – analytics dashboard.\n",
    "    - `/checkin` – QR-based check-in panel for on-site staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Development and tooling**\n",
    "  - **Testing**: Python `unittest` or `pytest` for unit and integration tests; custom scripts for concurrency/load testing.\n",
    "  - **Diagramming**: draw.io / Mermaid / similar tools for ER diagrams and system architecture diagrams.\n",
    "  - **API testing**: Postman / curl / VSCode REST Client.\n",
