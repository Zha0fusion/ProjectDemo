    "## 3. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project targets **exhibition and performance spaces**, such as public art venues, cultural centres, community theatres, library event areas, and science exhibition halls. These venues frequently host various **public, non-commercial events**, including talks, screenings, workshops, small performances, and themed exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, event registration and check-in in such venues often suffer from several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fragmented tools and siloed data**  \n",
    "  Many venues rely on a mixture of paper forms, Excel sheets, and ad-hoc online forms. Data for different events and sessions lives in different files or platforms. After events end, answering questions such as “which audience segments attended which types of events?” requires significant manual consolidation and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreliable capacity management**  \n",
    "  For popular events or small venues, staff need to enforce a strict capacity limit. Without a unified system, manual counting is error-prone: it is easy to over-book seats or fail to detect duplicated registrations.  \n",
    "  A typical problem in public venues is that some people **register early to “reserve” seats but never show up**, while others who genuinely want to attend cannot register because “the session is already full”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inefficient on-site check-in**  \n",
    "  Staff often check paper lists or manually search exported spreadsheets to verify attendees. This leads to long queues, mis-checks, and an overall poor experience for both staff and visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited analytics and service optimisation**  \n",
    "  Venues may want to know:  \n",
    "  - Which types of events attract which audience groups?  \n",
    "  - How do “members”, “media”, and general visitors differ in attendance behaviour?  \n",
    "  - What are the typical attendance rates for different time slots or themes?  \n",
    "  Due to fragmented data, these questions are hard to answer in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system aims to address these issues in a **public, non-commercial** context, focusing on **fair allocation of limited seats** and **data-driven service improvement**, rather than on ticket sales or payment processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. System Goals and Positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above context, we design and implement an **event registration and check-in system** for exhibition/performance spaces with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified management of multiple events and sessions**  \n",
    "   Model events that may span multiple days, each event consisting of multiple sessions (time slots). Each session has its own start/end time and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strict capacity control and fair allocation without payments**  \n",
    "   The system **does not handle any ticket prices, payments, or refunds**. All events are assumed to be **free to attend**.  \n",
    "   Instead of financial logic, the system focuses on:\n",
    "   - Per-session capacity limits;\n",
    "   - Waiting lists for popular sessions;\n",
    "   - A no-show penalty mechanism.  \n",
    "   Together, these aim to make seat allocation more orderly and fair in a public-resource setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improving resource utilisation and fairness with waiting lists and no-show penalties**  \n",
    "   - When a session is full, the system maintains a **waiting list**, typically in FIFO order. If a registered user cancels, waiting users can be automatically or semi-automatically promoted to `registered`.  \n",
    "   - For users who repeatedly register but do not show up (no-show), the system tracks their behaviour. If a user accumulates **three no-shows within 30 days**, their ability to register for new sessions is **blocked for one month**.  \n",
    "   These mechanisms are not about “punishing” users financially; they aim to:\n",
    "   - Reduce wasted seats caused by “reserve but never come” behaviour;\n",
    "   - Give genuinely interested visitors a better chance of obtaining a seat;\n",
    "   - Improve overall utilisation and fairness of limited public resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient QR-code based check-in**  \n",
    "   After successful registration, the system generates a digital “ticket” containing a QR code. The QR payload is a JSON object encoding the user and registration information.  \n",
    "   On-site staff use a dedicated **check-in panel** to scan the QR codes, verify the registration, and mark the attendee as checked-in. This reduces check-in bottlenecks, minimises manual search, and avoids concurrency problems at the check-in stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operator-facing analytics and export for further analysis**  \n",
    "   The system provides an analytics panel for staff to:\n",
    "   - View daily totals of registrations and check-ins across all sessions;\n",
    "   - Analyse participation and attendance by event type or tag;\n",
    "   - Analyse participation by audience group (e.g., VIP, Media, Member, General public);  \n",
    "   It also supports exporting per-event or per-session registration and attendance data to CSV, enabling further analysis and visualisation in external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Target Users and Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The application distinguishes three main roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visitor**  \n",
    "   - Browse upcoming events and sessions of the venue;\n",
    "   - Filter events by date, tag, or event type;\n",
    "   - Register for specific sessions and cancel registrations;\n",
    "   - Obtain a ticket with a QR code and use it for on-site check-in;\n",
    "   - Subject to the no-show policy: if they accumulate three no-shows within the last 30 days, their registration capability is blocked for one month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Staff**  \n",
    "   - Use the back-office interface to create/edit/archive events and sessions;\n",
    "   - Manage event tags and audience group information;\n",
    "   - View registration and attendance lists for events and sessions;\n",
    "   - **Force-add attendees** (e.g., VIPs, media guests, on-site registrations) regardless of normal capacity and waiting list constraints;\n",
    "   - Operate the check-in panel to scan QR codes and complete attendee check-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Admin**  \n",
    "   - A unique or very limited high-privilege account;\n",
    "   - Manages staff accounts, global configuration, and system integrity;\n",
    "   - Can perform low-level maintenance and corrective operations when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Core Features and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides several core functional modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event and session management**  \n",
    "   - An event (e.g., a week-long exhibition) can contain multiple sessions (e.g., different days or time slots).  \n",
    "   - Each session has its own:\n",
    "     - start and end time;\n",
    "     - capacity;\n",
    "     - `current_registered` counter;\n",
    "     - `waiting_list_limit`;\n",
    "     - status (open/closed).  \n",
    "   - Events have a lifecycle:  \n",
    "     - `draft`: being edited, not visible to visitors;  \n",
    "     - `published`: visible and open for registration (subject to session status);  \n",
    "     - `closed`: registration ended, sessions may still be checked-in or viewed;  \n",
    "     - `archived`: historical events kept for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Registration and waiting list**  \n",
    "   When a visitor attempts to register for a session:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `current_registered < capacity`:\n",
    "     - A new REGISTRATION is created with status `registered`;\n",
    "     - The session’s `current_registered` is incremented.\n",
    "   - Otherwise (session is full):\n",
    "     - If a waiting list is enabled and not full, the user is added as `waiting`;\n",
    "     - Otherwise, the registration is rejected as “full”.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When a registered user cancels:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Their REGISTRATION status is updated to `cancelled`;\n",
    "   - The session’s `current_registered` is decremented;\n",
    "   - If there are waiting users, the earliest waiting user can be promoted to `registered`, and `current_registered` is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This mechanism ensures that, for popular sessions, seats freed by cancellations can be reassigned to waiting visitors instead of being wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **QR-code based check-in and the check-in panel**  \n",
    "   - After a successful registration, the system generates a ticket-style image with an embedded QR code.\n",
    "   - The QR code encodes a JSON payload containing identifiers such as user ID, session ID, and registration ID.\n",
    "   - On-site staff use the check-in panel to scan the QR code:\n",
    "     - The panel sends a check-in request to the backend;\n",
    "     - The backend validates the registration, marks `checkin_time`, and returns basic visitor information (name, audience group, etc.);\n",
    "     - The panel displays this information to staff for quick verification.  \n",
    "   Because visitors physically queue to scan one by one, check-in concurrency is relatively low, and the operation is designed to be idempotent (repeated scans do not double-count check-ins).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No-show tracking and registration blocking**  \n",
    "   - A user is considered a **no-show** for a session if:\n",
    "     - their registration status is `registered`;\n",
    "     - the session has ended (end_time < now);\n",
    "     - `checkin_time` is still NULL.\n",
    "   - Each time a user tries to register for a new session, the system:\n",
    "     - Checks whether their `blocked_until` timestamp is in the future; if so, the registration is rejected;\n",
    "     - Otherwise, counts no-shows in the last 30 days. If the count is ≥ 3:\n",
    "       - The system sets `blocked_until` to 30 days from now;\n",
    "       - The current registration is rejected with an explanation.  \n",
    "   This mechanism is designed to protect the fairness and efficiency of public resource allocation by discouraging repeated “reserve but never come” behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytics and CSV export**  \n",
    "   - The analytics panel offers aggregate views, such as:\n",
    "     - Total number of registrations today across all sessions;\n",
    "     - Total number of check-ins today;\n",
    "     - Participation and attendance rates for specific event types or tags;\n",
    "     - Participation breakdown by audience group (e.g., VIP, Media, Member, General public).  \n",
    "   - For each event or session, staff can export a CSV file containing registration and attendance records, enabling further analysis in external tools (e.g., spreadsheets, BI dashboards).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Technical Focus: Concurrency and Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the expected concurrency level is moderate (e.g., around 100 concurrent users at peak), the project deliberately focuses on **transaction management and concurrency control**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrent registration and capacity enforcement**  \n",
    "   - The relational schema separates EVENT, EVENT_SESSION, and REGISTRATION, with `current_registered` maintained per session.\n",
    "   - During registration, the system uses:\n",
    "     - Database transactions;\n",
    "     - Row-level locking (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the session row).  \n",
    "   - This ensures that under concurrent registration workloads:\n",
    "     - The number of `registered` users never exceeds the configured capacity;\n",
    "     - The `current_registered` counter remains consistent with the underlying registrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We plan micro-benchmarks that simulate multiple threads registering simultaneously for a session with limited capacity, to empirically verify that no over-booking occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient analytical queries**  \n",
    "   - Appropriate indexes are defined on key columns (event type, session time, status, group_name, etc.).\n",
    "   - For the dashboard, we experiment with **serial vs. application-level parallel execution** of multiple analytic queries (e.g., using a thread pool), and compare response times to illustrate the impact of parallel query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Open-source and Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "A key design decision is to treat this system as an **open-source, reusable infrastructure component** for public and cultural venues, rather than a closed, venue-specific solution or a commercial ticketing platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No binding to payment providers or commercial ticketing platforms**  \n",
    "  The system does not manage any payment flow and does not depend on third-party ticketing services. Events are assumed to be free by default. This makes the system particularly suitable as a piece of infrastructure for public institutions and non-profit venues, without conflicting with any existing commercial ticketing workflows they may already use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployable in diverse venues**  \n",
    "  The system can be deployed in various contexts with minimal customisation:\n",
    "  - Art galleries, cultural centres, community theatres;\n",
    "  - Library event spaces, science museums;\n",
    "  - University venues hosting free public events.  \n",
    "  Venues can adapt the UI theme or audience group definitions (e.g., VIP / Media / Member / General) while keeping the core database and logic intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prepared for further extension and research**  \n",
    "  The database schema and interfaces are designed to be clear and modular, so that future work can extend the system with:\n",
    "  - More advanced role-based access control;\n",
    "  - Recommendation features based on users’ historical registrations;\n",
    "  - Deeper integration with external analytics or visualisation platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project provides a practical, open-source registration and check-in system tailored to public exhibition and performance spaces, while also serving as a case study in database modelling, transaction management, concurrency control, and analytical query optimisation in a non-commercial setting."

    "\n",
    "- **Monolithic backend service**  \n",
    "  All server-side functionality is implemented inside a single Flask application. Given the size and scope of this project, a monolithic architecture is more appropriate than microservices:\n",
    "  - It keeps deployment and configuration simple.\n",
    "  - It avoids the overhead of distributed transactions, inter-service communication, and complex DevOps.\n",
    "  - It is sufficient to demonstrate database design, transaction management, and concurrency control, which are the main technical focuses of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Front-end / back-end separation**  \n",
    "  The system is logically split into:\n",
    "  - A **Vue-based frontend** running in the browser, responsible for all user interactions and page rendering.\n",
    "  - A **Flask-based backend** exposing RESTful APIs for data access and business operations.\n",
    "  All communication between the frontend and backend is performed via HTTP(S) with JSON payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layered, MVC-style backend design**  \n",
    "  Inside the monolithic backend, we follow an MVC-ish layered structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **API / Controller layer**  \n",
    "     - Flask routes and blueprints act as controllers.  \n",
    "     - Responsibilities:\n",
    "       - Receive HTTP requests from the Vue frontend.\n",
    "       - Parse and validate request parameters and JSON bodies.\n",
    "       - Invoke the appropriate service methods.\n",
    "       - Return JSON responses and HTTP status codes.\n",

    "       - No-show detection and automatic blocking.\n",
    "       - Analytics queries and CSV export.\n",
    "     - This layer defines clear transactional boundaries and coordinates database operations through the repository layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Data Access / Repository layer**  \n",
    "     - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM models to represent database tables.\n",
    "     - Provides repository functions for CRUD operations and complex queries.\n",
    "     - Shields the service layer from raw SQL details and ensures consistent session/transaction handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. **Database layer**  \n",
    "     - A MySQL (InnoDB) database stores all persistent data and enforces integrity via primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.\n",
    "     - Transaction support and row-level locking are used to implement safe concurrent registration (e.g., using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on session rows).\n",

    "- **Backend**\n",
    "  - **Language**: Python 3.x  \n",
    "  - **Web framework**: Flask  \n",
    "    - Uses blueprints to organise APIs by domain (e.g., events, registrations, analytics).\n",
    "  - **ORM / Database access**: SQLAlchemy  \n",
    "    - Defines ORM models for `User`, `Event`, `EventSession`, `Registration`, `Tag`, etc.\n",
    "    - Manages sessions and transactions for all persistence operations.\n",
    "  - **Database**: MySQL 8.x (InnoDB, `utf8mb4`)  \n",
    "    - Stores all core domain data, including users, events, sessions, registrations, tags, and audience groups.\n",
    "    - InnoDB provides transactions and row-level locking, which are essential for enforcing per-session capacity under concurrent registrations.\n",
    "  - **Database driver**: `mysql+pymysql` (via the `pymysql` package).\n",
    "  - **Configuration**: `.env` + `python-dotenv`  \n",
    "    - Database URL, debug flags, and other settings are injected via environment variables.\n",
    "  - **Concurrency experiments**:\n",
    "    - Python standard library `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to simulate concurrent registration loads and compare different transaction strategies (e.g., with and without `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frontend**\n",
    "  - **Framework**: Vue (e.g., Vue 3 + Vite or Vue CLI)  \n",
    "  - **HTTP client**: Axios (or Fetch API) for calling backend REST APIs and handling JSON responses.\n",
    "  - **UI components**: A lightweight UI component library such as Element Plus / Ant Design Vue, or custom CSS for forms, tables, and dashboards.\n",
    "  - **Routing (examples)**:\n",
    "    - `/` – public event list and filters for visitors.\n",
    "    - `/events/:id` – event detail and session list.\n",
    "    - `/my-registrations` – “My registrations” page for visitors.\n",
    "    - `/admin/events` – staff/admin event and session management.\n",
    "    - `/admin/analytics` – analytics dashboard.\n",
    "    - `/checkin` – QR-based check-in panel for on-site staff.\n",

    "- **Development and tooling**\n",
    "  - **Testing**: Python `unittest` or `pytest` for unit and integration tests; custom scripts for concurrency/load testing.\n",
    "  - **Diagramming**: draw.io / Mermaid / similar tools for ER diagrams and system architecture diagrams.\n",
    "  - **API testing**: Postman / curl / VSCode REST Client.\n",

    "## 3. Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is implemented as a monolithic Flask application with a clear internal layering. The Flask app exposes RESTful JSON APIs under `/api/*`, organised into blueprints for authentication, events, registration, analytics, and check-in. Each API handler delegates to a corresponding service module that encapsulates business rules such as capacity checks, waiting-list promotion, no-show penalties, and analytics aggregation. The service layer, in turn, calls repositories and ORM models for database access. For write-heavy transactional flows it uses raw SQL via PyMySQL, while for analytics and reporting queries it uses SQLAlchemy ORM sessions and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend is implemented as a Vue-based single-page application. It communicates with the backend exclusively via HTTPS and JSON, using standard HTTP verbs and status codes. The main screens include: a public event list and details page, a registration flow with waiting list handling, a “My registrations” page, a check-in view that consumes QR codes, and a simple analytics dashboard for staff or administrators. All user-visible state transitions (e.g., moving from waiting to registered, or applying penalties after repeated no-shows) are triggered via backend APIs that enforce the same consistency rules regardless of which client is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is a MySQL 8.x instance using the InnoDB engine, with the schema designed and normalised as described in Section 2. The implementation closely follows the ER and schema diagrams (Figures 2 and 3), with additional indexes and constraints added via migrations and initialisation scripts. Data initialisation and demo data are provided through Python scripts so that the environment can be recreated in a repeatable way for development, testing, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Automated testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we adopted an automated testing strategy based on `pytest`. The backend includes smoke tests that verify the service is running and that key health endpoints (such as `/` and `/api/events/health`) return the expected JSON payloads and HTTP status codes. Unit tests focus on core service functions, for example the search module’s date parsing and error-handling logic, ensuring that invalid inputs and lower-level database failures are handled gracefully and reported through domain-specific exceptions rather than leaking internal errors to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simple unit and smoke tests, the test suite also contains integration tests that exercise full API flows against a real MySQL instance using the same schema as in production. These tests create events and sessions, perform registrations and cancellations, and verify that capacity tracking, waiting-list insertion and promotion, and QR-code based check-in are all reflected correctly in the database. Concurrency tests simulate a large number of users registering for the same session concurrently (using Python thread pools), and assert that no more than the configured capacity can be registered, that waiting-list positions remain consistent, and that there are no duplicate registrations per user per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance-oriented tests focus on ensuring that typical query paths—such as listing published events, searching by tag or keyword, or loading basic analytics—complete within a reasonable time budget (for example, less than one second on the development machine). These tests complement the indexing strategy described in Section 4 of the database design, and they help validate that the mix of OLTP and analytical queries can be served efficiently without resorting to premature denormalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Usability evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to automated tests, we conducted a small but systematic usability evaluation to verify that the system behaves as expected from an end-user perspective. The evaluation was documented in a “Usability Test Matrix” (in the DevNote), which defines realistic scenarios such as browsing published events, registering for an open session, being placed on a waiting list when a session is full, cancelling a registration to free a seat, scanning a QR code at the venue to check in, blocking registration for users with repeated no-shows, and loading a simple analytics dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each scenario, the matrix specifies the purpose, the concrete steps that a user or staff member should follow, the key metrics or checks (for example, correct status transitions, accurate counters, and response times within one second), and the expected result. The tests were executed by 夏晋, and all scenarios passed successfully. In practice this means that a visitor can discover events, complete registrations (or be placed on the waiting list if needed), receive a QR code, and check in at the venue without encountering inconsistent states; staff members can cancel registrations, monitor attendance, and review basic statistics; and the system enforces penalty rules for repeated no-shows. Taken together, the automated regression tests and the usability evaluation provide reasonable confidence that the system is both functionally correct and usable for the intended scale of a public event registration and check-in service."

    "## 3. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Context and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project targets exhibition and performance spaces, such as public art venues, cultural centres, community theatres, library event areas, and science exhibition halls. These venues frequently host various public, non-commercial events, including talks, screenings, workshops, small performances, and themed exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, event registration and on-site check-in in such venues often suffer from several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fragmented tools and siloed data**  \n",
    "  Many venues rely on a mixture of paper forms, spreadsheet files, and ad‑hoc online forms. Data for different events and sessions lives in different files or platforms. After events end, answering questions such as “which audience segments attended which types of events?” requires significant manual consolidation and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreliable capacity management**  \n",
    "  For popular events or small venues, staff need to enforce strict capacity limits. Without a unified system, manual counting is error‑prone: it is easy to over‑book seats or fail to detect duplicated registrations. A typical problem in public venues is that some people register early to “reserve” seats but never show up, while others who genuinely want to attend cannot register because the session is already full.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inefficient on‑site check‑in**  \n",
    "  Staff often check paper lists or manually search exported spreadsheets to verify attendees. This leads to long queues, mis‑checks, and an overall poor experience for both staff and visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited analytics and service optimisation**  \n",
    "  Venues may want to know, for example: which types of events attract which audience groups; how “members”, “media”, and general visitors differ in attendance behaviour; and what the typical attendance rates are for different time slots or themes. Due to fragmented data, these questions are hard to answer in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system aims to address these issues in a public, non‑commercial context, focusing on fair allocation of limited seats and data‑driven service improvement, rather than on ticket sales or payment processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 System Goals and Positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above context, we design and implement an event registration and check‑in system for exhibition and performance spaces with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified management of multiple events and sessions**  \n",
    "   Model events that may span multiple days, each consisting of multiple sessions (time slots). Each session has its own start and end time and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strict capacity control and fair allocation without payments**  \n",
    "   The system does not handle any ticket prices, payments, or refunds. All events are assumed to be free to attend. Instead of financial logic, the system focuses on:\n",
    "   - Per‑session capacity limits;\n",
    "   - Waiting lists for popular sessions;\n",
    "   - A no‑show penalty mechanism.  \n",
    "   Together, these aim to make seat allocation more orderly and fair in a public‑resource setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved resource utilisation through waiting lists and no‑show penalties**  \n",
    "   When a session is full, the system maintains a waiting list (typically first‑in‑first‑out). If a registered user cancels, waiting users can be automatically or semi‑automatically promoted to “registered”. For visitors who repeatedly register but do not show up, the system tracks no‑show occurrences. If a user accumulates three no‑shows within 30 days, their ability to register for new sessions is blocked for one month. The goal is not financial punishment but to reduce wasted seats and to give genuinely interested visitors a better chance of attending.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient QR‑code‑based check‑in**  \n",
    "   After successful registration, the system generates a digital ticket containing a QR code whose payload is a JSON object encoding the user and registration information. On‑site staff use a dedicated check‑in panel to scan these codes, verify the registration, and mark the attendee as checked‑in, reducing bottlenecks and manual search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operator‑facing analytics and export for further analysis**  \n",
    "   The system provides an analytics panel for staff to view daily totals of registrations and check‑ins, to analyse participation by event type or tag and by audience group (for example, VIP, Media, Member, General public), and to export per‑event or per‑session data to CSV for further analysis in external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Target Users and Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The application distinguishes three main roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visitor**  \n",
    "   Browses upcoming events and sessions, filters events by date or tag, registers for sessions and cancels registrations, obtains a QR‑code ticket for on‑site check‑in, and is subject to the no‑show policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Staff**  \n",
    "   Uses the back‑office interface to create, edit, and archive events and sessions; manage tags and audience groups; view registration and attendance lists; force‑add attendees (for example, VIPs, media, on‑site registrations) regardless of normal capacity; and operate the check‑in panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Admin**  \n",
    "   A high‑privilege role that manages staff accounts, global configuration, and system integrity, and performs low‑level maintenance and corrective operations when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Core Features and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides several core functional modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event and session management**  \n",
    "   Events can contain multiple sessions, each with start and end time, capacity, current registration count, waiting list limit, and status. Events have a lifecycle of draft, published, closed, and archived.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Registration and waiting list management**  \n",
    "   When a visitor attempts to register, the system either creates a registered record and increments the session’s counter or, if the session is full, places the visitor in a waiting list (if enabled) or rejects the registration as “full”. When a registered user cancels, capacity is freed and can be allocated to the earliest waiting user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **QR‑code‑based check‑in and check‑in panel**  \n",
    "   The system generates ticket‑style QR codes with JSON payloads containing user and session identifiers. The check‑in panel scans codes, validates registrations, records check‑in timestamps, and displays key information for staff verification. Check‑in operations are idempotent to avoid double counting under repeated scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No‑show tracking and registration blocking**  \n",
    "   A no‑show is defined as a registration that remains in “registered” status without a check‑in after the session has ended. When a user attempts to register, the system checks their recent no‑show count and may block new registrations if the penalty threshold is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytics and CSV export**  \n",
    "   Staff can access aggregate dashboards for registrations and check‑ins and can export detailed event or session data as CSV files for external analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Technical Focus: Concurrency and Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the expected concurrency level is moderate (for example, around one hundred concurrent users at peak), the project intentionally focuses on transaction management and concurrency control:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The relational schema separates events, sessions, and registrations, with a maintained `current_registered` field per session.\n",
    "- During registration, database transactions and row‑level locks (for example, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) are used to ensure that the number of registered users never exceeds the configured capacity and that counters remain consistent.\n",
    "- Micro‑benchmarks simulate multiple threads registering for the same session to confirm experimentally that over‑booking does not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Open‑Source Orientation and Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed as an open‑source, reusable infrastructure component for public and cultural venues, rather than as a venue‑specific or commercial ticketing platform. It is decoupled from payment providers and commercial ticketing services, assumes free events by default, and can be deployed in various venues (galleries, cultural centres, libraries, universities) with minimal customisation, mainly through configuration of audience groups and user interface themes. The database schema and APIs are intentionally modular to allow future extensions such as more advanced role‑based access control, recommendation features, or deeper integration with analytical platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Technical Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Software Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt a monolithic web application architecture with a clear front‑end / back‑end separation and a layered, Model–View–Controller‑style structure on the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monolithic backend service**  \n",
    "  All server‑side functionality is implemented in a single Flask application. This simplifies deployment and configuration and is sufficient to demonstrate database design, transaction management, and concurrency control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Front‑end / back‑end separation**  \n",
    "  A Vue‑based frontend running in the browser interacts with a Flask‑based backend through RESTful HTTP interfaces with JSON payloads. The frontend is responsible for all user interactions and rendering, while the backend exposes APIs for data access and business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layered backend design**  \n",
    "  Inside the Flask application we distinguish:\n",
    "  1. **API / Controller layer** – Flask routes and blueprints that receive HTTP requests, validate input, delegate to services, and return JSON responses with appropriate status codes.  \n",
    "  2. **Service (business logic) layer** – Implements registration and cancellation flows, waiting‑list management, no‑show detection and blocking, analytics aggregation, and CSV export.  \n",
    "  3. **Data access / Repository layer** – Wraps SQLAlchemy ORM models and raw SQL where necessary, providing repository functions and controlling sessions and transactions.  \n",
    "  4. **Database layer** – A MySQL (InnoDB) database that stores persistent data and enforces integrity via primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, and that provides transactionality and row‑level locking.\n",

    "### 4.3 System Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level the system consists of three types of clients (visitor, staff/admin, and check‑in panel), a Vue frontend, a layered Flask backend, and a MySQL database. All user interaction happens through web browsers, and all communication between the frontend and backend uses JSON‑based REST APIs over HTTP(S). The MySQL database serves as the single source of truth and provides transactional guarantees, while the analytics queries are supported by appropriate indexing.\n",

    "## 5. Database Design (Track 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The database design for Track 1 includes entities for users, organisations, event types, events, sessions, tags, registrations, audience groups, and per‑event audience group assignments, with relationships and constraints described through an ER model and a normalised schema. The schema is designed to satisfy at least Third Normal Form, reducing redundancy while supporting both transactional and analytical workloads. It also includes an indexing strategy and sample SQL queries for common access paths, no‑show logic, and analytics by audience group and event type.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Evaluation and Results (Track 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation for Track 1 focuses on query correctness, efficiency, and usability of the registration and check‑in flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional and integration correctness**  \n",
    "  Automated tests and manual scenarios verify that registrations respect capacity limits, waiting‑list promotion works correctly, no‑show penalties are enforced, and QR‑code check‑in updates the database consistently. Integration tests exercise full API flows against a real MySQL instance using the same schema as in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrency and capacity enforcement**  \n",
    "  Micro‑benchmarks simulate many concurrent registration attempts for sessions with limited capacity. The results confirm that, under transaction and locking settings, the number of registered users never exceeds the configured capacity and that waiting‑list positions remain consistent. No duplicate registrations per user per session were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query performance and analytics responsiveness**  \n",
    "  Performance‑oriented tests measure the response times of typical query paths such as listing published events, searching by tag, loading per‑day registration and check‑in statistics, and computing participation by audience group. For the tested dataset size, these queries complete within an acceptable latency budget (for example, within one second on the development environment), validating the indexing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usability evaluation**  \n",
    "  A small but systematic usability evaluation, documented in a “Usability Test Matrix”, covers realistic scenarios such as browsing published events, registering for open sessions, being placed on a waiting list, cancelling to free a seat, scanning QR codes at the venue, blocking users with repeated no‑shows, and loading the analytics dashboard. All defined scenarios were executed and passed, indicating that the system is usable for the intended context and scale.\n",

    "## 7. Challenges and Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "During the project the team encountered several practical challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time management and planning**  \n",
    "   The team did not always manage time effectively. Some key tasks (such as writing automated tests and polishing the user interface) were postponed until late stages of the project. This resulted in a compressed schedule before the deadline and limited opportunities to refactor or explore alternative designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Team communication and collaboration**  \n",
    "   Communication within the team was not always smooth. At times requirements and design decisions were not fully aligned across members, leading to duplicated work and integration conflicts, especially between frontend and backend interfaces. Regular stand‑up style meetings and clearer task assignment would have reduced misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collaboration workflow and coordination**  \n",
    "   Although GitHub was used for version control, the team needed time to adapt to a more disciplined workflow. For example, merge conflicts occurred when branches were not synchronised frequently enough, and some pull requests lacked detailed descriptions or code reviews. This slowed down progress when multiple members were working on related modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Containerisation and deployment attempts with Docker**  \n",
    "   The team attempted to use Docker and Docker Compose to simplify deployment of the backend, frontend, and database. However, repeated failures in writing a correct `docker-compose.yml` file (for example, incorrect service dependencies, environment configuration, and networking between containers) led to a significant time cost without a stable outcome. Due to time pressure, the team decided to fall back to a more manual deployment approach and to leave a robust Docker‑based deployment as future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Balancing functionality, performance, and simplicity**  \n",
    "   The project needed to demonstrate non‑trivial concurrency control and analytics while remaining implementable within the course timeline. Designing the database and APIs so that they were both conceptually clean and efficient in practice required several iterations and trade‑offs, especially for no‑show tracking and audience group management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, the team gained several important lessons and practical skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using GitHub for collaborative software development**  \n",
    "   The team learned to use Git and GitHub for collaborative coding: creating branches for features, committing frequently, opening pull requests, resolving merge conflicts, and reviewing code. This experience highlighted the importance of clear commit messages, branch naming conventions, and basic continuous integration to maintain code quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding software architecture and REST‑based front‑end / back‑end separation**  \n",
    "   The project provided concrete experience with a layered software architecture: a Vue frontend calling REST APIs implemented in a Flask backend, which in turn interacts with a relational database. The team gained a deeper understanding of separation of concerns, API design, stateless communication, and how architectural decisions influence maintainability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementing a backend using Python and Flask**  \n",
    "   The team became more familiar with building backend services in Python, including defining REST endpoints in Flask, managing request validation and error handling, organising code into controllers, services, and repositories, and working with SQLAlchemy ORM and raw SQL when necessary. The importance of transactions and row‑level locking for data integrity became much clearer through hands‑on implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Designing and normalising a relational database schema**  \n",
    "   Through the iterative design of the schema, the team learned how to model entities and relationships, apply normalisation (up to at least Third Normal Form), define primary and foreign keys, and design indexes for both transactional and analytical queries. Modelling configurable audience groups and per‑event group assignments was a concrete example of translating requirements into a clean schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Writing automated tests and designing usability scenarios**  \n",
    "   Implementing pytest‑based unit and integration tests showed the value of automated regression testing. At the same time, designing a usability test matrix demonstrated that non‑functional aspects—such as user experience, clarity of flows, and response time—are as important as pure functional correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Appreciating the importance of planning and communication**  \n",
    "   Finally, the difficulties with time management, communication, and Docker‑based deployment underlined that software engineering is not only about coding. Early planning, realistic scoping, clear communication, and incremental integration are crucial for delivering a reliable system within limited time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges and lessons significantly shaped how the team understands software engineering practice and will influence how future projects are planned, implemented, and evaluated."
